          This is a full-stack application. <br />I built the front-end using
          HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript then hosted it with
          <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/" target="_blank"
            >Firebase</a
          >. I built the back-end using Node.js, Express, and SQL queries. My
          API is hosted on
          <a href="https://render.com/" target="_blank">Render</a> and my
          database is hosted on
          <a href="https://www.phpmyadmin.net/" target="_blank"> phpMyAdmin</a>
          (MySQL).
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can create a new todo item by clicking the "TODO" button at the
          top. Users can also delete todo items by clicking the X next to each
          item. <br />
          All todo items are required to have a description, type and priority.
          Users can then sort their todo items by priority, type or date.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment this is only for the purpose of gaining experience in
          full-stack development and is not set up for multiple clients.<br />
          In the future I hope to add a login and authentication for each user.
          Then in my database I can differentiate one user's items from another
          and each user will see only their items. I also hope to add an update
          feature for todo items so that users can update the priority of an
          item as they continue to procrastinate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bob's TODO List is inspired by the Bobiverse series by Dennis E Taylor
          (recommend!).

          The front-end of this app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and it is
          hosted with
          <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/" target="_blank"
            >Firebase</a
          >. When the user searches for a book title, the app makes a call to
          the
          <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started?csw=1"
            target="_blank"
          >
            Google's Books API</a
          >
          using async/await and fetch then displays the title, author, and a
          description. The user can then add a book to the reading list. Books
          on the reading list can be marked "finished" or be removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment this app has no data persistence. I will be updating
          this app in the future to connect to my own api in order to save a
          user's reading list on my database. Login and authentication features
          to follow.
